Project 977: Self-supervised Learning Methods
Description
Self-supervised learning is a type of unsupervised learning where the model generates its own labels from the input data. This approach enables training models without relying on labeled data. In this project, we will implement a self-supervised learning framework using techniques like contrastive learning or predictive modeling for tasks such as image or text representation learning.

Python Implementation with Comments (Self-supervised Learning with Contrastive Learning)
We will implement contrastive learning, where the model learns to differentiate between positive and negative pairs of images. We'll use a popular self-supervised learning method, SimCLR (Simple Contrastive Learning of Representations), which learns representations by maximizing the similarity between augmented views of the same image.

First, install the necessary libraries:

pip install torch torchvision
Here’s the basic implementation using SimCLR in PyTorch:

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import datasets, transforms, models
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
import numpy as np
 
# Define the SimCLR model architecture
class SimCLR(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, base_model, projection_dim=128):
        super(SimCLR, self).__init__()
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.base_model.fc = nn.Identity()  # Remove the final fully connected layer
        self.projection_head = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(self.base_model.fc.in_features, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, projection_dim)
        )
 
    def forward(self, x):
        features = self.base_model(x)
        projections = self.projection_head(features)
        return projections
 
# Define the contrastive loss (NT-Xent Loss)
class ContrastiveLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, temperature=0.5):
        super(ContrastiveLoss, self).__init__()
        self.temperature = temperature
 
    def forward(self, z_i, z_j):
        # Normalize the projections
        z_i = nn.functional.normalize(z_i, dim=-1, p=2)
        z_j = nn.functional.normalize(z_j, dim=-1, p=2)
        
        # Compute similarity matrix
        similarity_matrix = torch.matmul(z_i, z_j.T) / self.temperature
        
        # Create labels: positive pairs (same image, different augmentations)
        labels = torch.arange(z_i.size(0)).long().to(z_i.device)
        
        # Compute the contrastive loss (NT-Xent loss)
        loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(similarity_matrix, labels)
        return loss
 
# Define the data augmentations for contrastive learning
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])
 
# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
train_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=256, shuffle=True, num_workers=4)
 
# Initialize the pre-trained ResNet-50 model and SimCLR model
base_model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
simclr_model = SimCLR(base_model)
 
# Define the optimizer and loss function
optimizer = optim.Adam(simclr_model.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
contrastive_loss_fn = ContrastiveLoss()
 
# Train the model using contrastive learning
for epoch in range(5):  # Training for 5 epochs
    simclr_model.train()
    total_loss = 0
    for data, _ in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
 
        # Generate positive pairs (augmented views of the same image)
        data_aug1 = data
        data_aug2 = data  # For simplicity, we'll use the same batch as augmented pairs here
        
        # Forward pass for the augmented views
        projections1 = simclr_model(data_aug1)
        projections2 = simclr_model(data_aug2)
 
        # Compute the contrastive loss
        loss = contrastive_loss_fn(projections1, projections2)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
 
        total_loss += loss.item()
 
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {total_loss / len(train_loader)}")
 
# Evaluate the model (if needed, apply to downstream tasks)
# This is a self-supervised learning setup, so the downstream task is often a separate evaluation.
Key Concepts Covered:
Self-supervised Learning: A learning method where the model generates its own labels from the input data.

Contrastive Learning: A technique where the model learns to pull together similar pairs and push apart dissimilar ones, optimizing representations.

SimCLR: A specific contrastive learning method that maximizes the similarity between augmented views of the same image and minimizes the similarity between different images.
